	<p>In September 2010, Emily Hopkins bought an overpriced vintage roadbike off Craigslist. That bike almost killed them several times before they let it rot in an Allston snowbank. Emily would eventually go on to buy a much more reasonably priced and somehow still vintage bike, which they have named Bikey with the Good Hair (NB: The bike does not have any actual hair.)</p>
