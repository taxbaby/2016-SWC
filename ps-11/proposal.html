      <h3>Emily's Project Proposal</h3>
      <p>Produce 1-3 graphs using data related to Boston's Roxbury area to demonstrate current challenges and changes the neighborhood faces during Boston's housing crisis and development boom</p>

      <p>Graphs will be made using HTML, CSS, JS and d3. The fewer the graphs, the more intricate they will be (i.e., if one graph is submitted, it will have maximized interactivity, etc, whereas three graphs will have fewer bells and whistles.</p>

      <h1>OR</h1>

      <p>Something less ambitious because I never give myself enough restraints.</p>
