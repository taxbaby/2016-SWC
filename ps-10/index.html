	<p id="aboutme">Roxbury is at the heart of a neighborhood well versed in community activism and mobilization. When the trifecta of urban renewal, white flight and disinvestment hit the area, Roxburyâ€™s community members found a way to take over empty lots, create affordable housing, and fill vacant buildings.<br><br>
