	<p id="aboutme">Roxbury is at the heart of a neighborhood well versed in community activism and mobilization. When the trifecta of urban renewal, white flight and disinvestment hit the area, Roxburyâ€™s community members found a way to take over empty lots, create affordable housing, and fill vacant buildings.<br><br>
	Now, like the rest of the city, this neighborhood is facing steep rent and property value increases, which has a lot of people wondering if they will be able to stay in Roxbury much longer.<br><br>
	We're zooming in on Roxbury to find out what's happening and how people hope to shape the neighborhood moving forward.</p>
